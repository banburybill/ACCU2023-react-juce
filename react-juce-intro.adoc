This talk is NOT divine wisdom delivered to a hushed group of penitents.

It's about the whys and wherefores of mixing programming languages in
a single executable and why you might do it. I'm hoping that you'll be
able to share similar stories to me.

For a room of the average unwashed C++ programmer, there's a bit of explaining to do here.

This is the hand-wavey 30,000ft (FL300) view of what I'm going to talk about.

But that first item is doing a LOT of heavy lifting.

Should one described JUCE before React? Nice question. I'm going this
way round because JUCE is a C++ thing that will be more familiar, and
so there is much less to say about it.
