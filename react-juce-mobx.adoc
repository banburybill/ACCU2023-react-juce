mobx is an open-source state management tool.

Development hosted in GitHUb. MIT licenced.

== What is Mobx?

* A simple, scalable state management library.
* Prevents inconsistent state by ensuring that all derivations are performed automatically.
* "MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state."

[.notes]
--
Organised state management that works with React. If mobx is managing
your state, it will let React know when it needs to re-render.

== Example

[.stretch]
....
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import { makeAutoObservable } from "mobx"
import { observer } from "mobx-react-lite"

class Timer {
    secondsPassed = 0

    constructor() {
        makeAutoObservable(this)
    }

    increaseTimer() {
        this.secondsPassed += 1
    }
}

const myTimer = new Timer()

// A function component wrapped with `observer` will react
// to any future change in an observable it used before.
const TimerView = observer(({ timer }) => <span>Seconds passed: {timer.secondsPassed}</span>)

ReactDOM.render(<TimerView timer={myTimer} />, document.body)

setInterval(() => {
    myTimer.increaseTimer()
}, 1000)
....

observer() wraps the TimerView implementation and automatically
updates it when timer changes.

....
[{"op":"replace","path":"/project/currentItem/id","value":3003},
