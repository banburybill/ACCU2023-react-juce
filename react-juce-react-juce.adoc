== Hermes

Being a JS based thing (well, the React part, anyway), it obviously
needs a JavaScript engine. It was originally written to use DukTape,
but we are using Hermes.

Hermes comes from Facebook, and is now the default JS engine for React
Native. It's designed for mobile devices and for fast startup.

Hermes compiles JS to a bytecode and then interprets that
bytecode. Significantly, it's *not* a JITing system. Compiling can be
ahead of time, reducing startup time and memory usage. It includes a
concurrent GC.

I'm guessing the lack of native code JIT is down to wanting to keep
memory footprint small (though I did work on a low-memory JITing JVM
20 years ago). It may also have something to do with Apple's ban on
native code generation (and unhappiness about GC) for App Store.

== Yoga

The other major sub-component of React Native is also used in React Native.

Yoga is a Flexbox layout engine. And guess what, it's also a Facebook Open Source component.

== Demo time

[.notes]
--
Time to see RJ in action. I had hoped to be showing something of what we've been working
on, but it's not released yet so I have to fall back in the RJ examples. Of which there is one.
Which at least means I don't have to think too hard about which example to pick.

So, _show the example app in action_.
--

== Why's it look like that?

[.notes]
--
The example program has a single C++ module. It relies on JUCE's
AudioProcessor class, which provides a plugin and hosting environment,
and just requires the app to specify an editor.

Let's look first at the React code that specifies the display.

App.js
--

== How does that meter work?

[.notes]
--
Meter.js

Look at how the meter is drawn. Explain about onMeasure.

Where does that gainPeakValues event come from?
--

== Back in C++ land

[.notes]
--
PluginProcessor.cpp. And PluginProgressor.h.

Uses JUCE's AudioProcessor setup to make the plugin. And provide the standalone host.

Look, there's the event being sent. But what's that code above? GenericEditor?
And this is the only C++ module. Looks like that's how the UI gets started?
--

== Let's dive a bit further

[.notes]
--
GenericEditor.h, GenericEditor.cpp.

Check out the constructor. What's that harness doing?
--

== The app harness

[.notes]
--
AppHarness.h, AppHarness.cpp.

handleFilesChanged()
--

== All roads lead back to appRoot

[.notes]
--
ReactApplicationRoot.h, .cpp.

Let's look at evaluate().
--

== A first look at the engine

[.notes]
--
EmacsEngine.h, _Hermes.cpp.

Let's look at evaluate().

So here we are diving into the engine. Note the result return and the
conversion from Hermes variable type to/from JUCE variants.

So that's how it all gets off the group and returns control to the
JUCE event loop. How do events get handled?
--

== Sending events from the application

[.notes]
--
PluginProcessor.cpp. Timer callback.

Back in ReactApplicationRoot.h, what's happening in dispatchEvent?
It's calling invoke on the engine.
--

== Invoking a function

[.notes]
--
EmacsEngine_Hermes..cpp. invoke.

Fishing the function out of the JS data, and call it. Convert the arguments and return.
--

== OK, where is JS dispatchEvent?

[.notes]
--
NativeMethods.js. And EventBridge.js.

EventEmitter is a JS module. Obtained from npm.
