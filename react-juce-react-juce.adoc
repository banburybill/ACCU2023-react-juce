== Hermes

Being a JS based thing (well, the React part, anyway), it obviously
needs a JavaScript engine. It was originally written to use DukTape,
but we are using Hermes.

Hermes comes from Facebook, and is now the default JS engine for React
Native. It's designed for mobile devices and for fast startup.

Hermes compiles JS to a bytecode and then interprets that
bytecode. Significantly, it's *not* a JITing system. Compiling can be
ahead of time, reducing startup time and memory usage. It includes a
concurrent GC.

I'm guessing the lack of native code JIT is down to wanting to keep
memory footprint small (though I did work on a low-memory JITing JVM
20 years ago). It may also have something to do with Apple's ban on
native code generation (and unhappiness about GC) for App Store.

The other major sub-component of React Native is also used in React Native.

Yoga is a Flexbox layout engine. And guess what, it's also a Facebook Open Source component.
