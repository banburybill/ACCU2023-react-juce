React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
building user interfaces based on components.

It's not an application library. React is UI only.

First public release July 2013, but first used in 2011.

Development hosted in GitHUb. MIT licenced.

A magazine cover from February 1981 where the feature article was
about how computers would soon be writing programs themselves and
programmers would be redundant. Plus Ã§a change...

ACCU regulars will wonder if Roger Orr posed for the picture.

Dunno about you, but for this long-time
C/C++/Python/bash/Java etc. dev, this webby stuff is a Whole New
World. Populated by people who need a 11 line library function
downloaded from an online rope to left pad strings, the widthdrawl of
which (2016) breaks a shedload of websites. Breakage
includes ... React.

If you've not come across JS before, curbralan habitues will be
puzzled by !== (basically not-screwed-up !=). Modern JS (ES6) prefers
let to var. Note. I will in the rest of this ramble be talking about
ES6 when I refer to JS. Also, I'm not going to attempt to teach JS
and/or Typescript. Or React. I just want to give a flavour.

== But, but, Jim! React!?

For the love of $DEITY, why?

[.notes]

Look, what where you thinking? I mean, JavaScript? Why?

There are reasons.
--

== Why React?

[.step]
* Declarative UI.
* Avoid long compile-link cycle.
* Because It's There.

== React Hello World
[.stretch]
....
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const Greeting = () => {
    return (
        <div className="hello-world">
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

const App = () => {
    return <Greeting />;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
);
....

Hello, World for React.

Greeting is a functional component.  There's actually a bit more
boilerplate code for the enclosing HTML page.
--

== JSX

....
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
....

....
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
....

[.notes]
--
JSX is a JavaScript syntax extension. It produces React elements.
JSX tags can include children.

Note `className` in the above. React DOM uses `camelCase` for its
property names as it's closer to JS that HTML. Here, the HTML
attribute name `class` can't be used as it's a JS reserved word, so
`className` is used instead.
--


== Component properties
[.stretch]
....
const Greeting = (props) => {
    return (
        <div className="hello-world">
            <h1>Hello,  { props.name }!</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

const App = () => {
    return <Greeting name="there"/>;
};
....

[.notes]
--
You can parameterise components using properties (props).

Note the next little bit of JSX. Items in {} are subsitituted. You can use any valid JS.

When the property changes, the component *and all its children* will re-render.
--

== Component state
[.stretch]
....
function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
      >Blue</button>
    </>
  )
}
....

[.notes]
--
Component also refresh when their *state* changes.

So React is react-ive. You don't worry about needing to command
repaints. React will automatically update when the data commands so.
--

== React rendering

[.stretch]
....
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const Greeting = () => {
    return (
        <div className="hello-world">
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        </div>
    );
};
....

[.notes]
--
So, React runs this function every time the data changes. Doesn't that
mean that every time the data changes everything re-renders? And what
happens if you're doing a text input or something?
--


== Virtual DOM

image::reconciler.png[width="50%"]

[.notes]
--
What React does is re-render on each change, but the re-render
generates a *virtual* DOM, an intermediate representation of how stuff
should look. Once that is done, the *reconciler* triggers. This checks
the virtual representation against the actual current display, and
performs a (heuristically determined) minimal change set to bring the
actual display up to date.

We'll see a bit more of the reconciler later.
--

== ReactDOM?
[.stretch]
....
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const Greeting = () => {
    return (
        <div className="hello-world">
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        </div>
    );
};
....

[.notes]
--
Going back to our Hello World for a moment.  One important thing to
notice here is the react-dom stuff. DOM==HTML/CSS Domain Object
Model. As is obvious from the <div> <h1>, we're firmly in HTML (and
CSS) land here.

So why is React a separate library from ReactDOM?

== React Native

* A framework for native UI for applications.
** Android,  Android TV
** iOS, MacOS
** tvOS, Web(!)
** Windows - Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
* Used for Android & iOS apps at Facebook, Microsoft, Shopify.

[.notes]

React Native, a framework for writing native applications deputed in
2015.
--

== React Native example
[.stretch]
....
import React from 'react';
import {View, Text, Image, ScrollView, TextInput} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ScrollView>
      <Text>Some text</Text>
      <View>
        <Text>Some more text</Text>
        <Image
          source={{
            uri: 'https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/p_cat2.png',
          }}
          style={{width: 200, height: 200}}
        />
      </View>
      <TextInput
        style={{
          height: 40,
          borderColor: 'gray',
          borderWidth: 1,
        }}
        defaultValue="You can type in me"
      />
    </ScrollView>
....

[.notes]
--
This LOOKs HTML/CSS like, with HTML style XML components and CSS type
styling, but in fact contains neither. Each item is a native
component. These native components are, though, arranged in a
parent-child hierarchy, just as in ReactDOM.

The crucial point here is that React Native uses exactly the same
React module as ReactDOM, but a completely different back end.
