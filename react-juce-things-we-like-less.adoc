== Things we like less about React JUCE

[.step]
* Getting up to speed with Javascript.
* Getting up to speed with Typescript.
* Getting up to speed with React.
* Getting up to speed with mobx.
* So, Time.
* Speed.
* The tide went out.

Dear departed Hubert always used to say that if you introduced a new
language or framework into a project, his rule of thumb was that you
added 18 months to that project.

We can quibble about the time, but the point stands.

I've had a few React people say to me that speed isn't really a thing
in the ReactDOM world. On a desktop browser, these day you have a
beefy JITting JS engine that goes like stink. Hermes is good, but not
that good.

And finally, RJ is not exactly under active development. However, it's
there and is works. If your niche is needing a declarative UI for
JUCE, you are not overburdened with choices.
